When you cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to draw on the link. Doing so means you expend no spell slots to cast the spell, the energy instead comes from the external power. The more you draw on the link, the harder it is to maintain. Each spell you cast in this manner decreases the duration of the arcane parasite spell by 10 minutes per level of the spell you cast using the link. For example, if you cast a fireball spell using the link, you would not expend a spell slot in the casting, but the duration of this spell would decrease by 30 minutes. If you cast a spell using the link and your remaining duration is equal to or less than the spell’s level × 10 minutes, then this spell ends as soon as that spell is cast."

Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma can be adjusted up or down by the GM to fit unusual circumstances.

Any alterations made to the ice remain after the spell ends, but can be altered by other effects (temperature, seismic action, or another application of this spell, for example). \n   Crack. You cause ice in the area to crack and splinter. On level terrain, this effect turns the ice into difficult terrain, possibly producing other hazards, depending on the terrain and the nature of the ice—ice over a deep chasm might open onto a pit, while ice over water can break into individual floes, for example. Using this effect on cliffs, walls, or ceilings made of ice can cause collapse, dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area below the collapse, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. After such a collapse, the area where the fallen ice collects becomes difficult terrain. \n   Reshape. You cause ice in a portion of the area to rapidly melt, move, and re-form into whatever shape you command. You can block holes, open tunnels, form bridges, remove difficult terrain, or otherwise alter the form of the ice in the area. You can cause ice to become slippery, making it difficult terrain, or dry to remove difficult terrain. You can fill a hole up to a 20-foot cube or create 20 feet (up to 20 feet wide) of a bridge across a chasm or raise a 20-foot-tall pillar of ice (up to 20 feet square). You can continue this action on consecutive rounds to increase the size of the affected area while you maintain concentration on the spell. \n   Thicken/Thin. You cause existing ice to increase or decrease in thickness, up to 1 inch per round over some or all of the total area, either making the surface stronger or creating thin ice that is hazardous to walk on."

The earth rises in a 15-foot-high, 15-foot‑radius swell that can carry you and up to eight other Medium creatures, propelling you in whatever direction you choose at a rate of up to 90 feet per round. You use a bonus action to direct the wave each round. Your movement is limited to the surface of the wave to maintain control. If you move off the wave, it continues on the same course you directed it, then the spell ends at the beginning of your next turn. Natural obstacles do not impede the spell’s movement; trees, rocks, and other natural obstacles simply rise up and around the swell and settle back into place behind it. The wave can travel up or down natural slopes with angles as great as 60 degrees. You can direct the wave to surge over man-made obstacles and creatures in its path. The swell washes over walls and other manufactured obstacles up to 15 feet high and 10 feet thick with no loss of movement, dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to an object as it passes. Resolve this damage against larger, rigid objects, such as walls, vehicles, or other similar structures; smaller or malleable objects such as unsecured ropes or cloth are simply buried by the swell’s passing. Larger objects are subject to the damage, but the wave cannot move over them unless the damage is enough to destroy the object. Creatures of Large size or smaller in the path of the wave take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and are buried. Buried creatures are considered restrained and must hold their breath or begin to suffocate. A creature in the path of the wave can make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and avoids being buried.
